== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements? =

PHP >= 5.4 is required. This is usually the case for most of websites.
If you don't have the required version of PHP, you'll see a simple warning that PHP should be upgraded.

= How does it work? =

You create or upload a PDF to your WordPress dashboard.
The template is sent to our server, and we generate the file for you.
The file is sent back to your website.

= Why can't I generate PDF files on my server? =

The reason for this is that PDF generation requires a lot of software, which is not available on most websites.
For example, Java, GhostScript, PdfTk, etc.
This means that you simply can't run it on any server.
Nevertheless, if you own a VPS server, you can generate PDFs on your server. Please refer to how to install offline version article on our website.

= Security =

We don't store any data except for PDF templates.
Storing PDFs is done to speed up PDF generation process.
